Hi, I am naurril, a software engineer.

My insterests include programming languages, machine learning algorithms, big data analysis  platform/architecture. Sometimes I do bigdata/ML competitons, and I got a runner-up in [The Last Mile Rush] competition hosted by Tianchi Aliyun in 2016.

I write codes in c/c++,scala,common lisp,python,R,haskell. In [The Last Mile Rush] competition, I implemented a complicated large-scale [VRP] optimization algorithm in common lisp, and I also committed a bug fix to [SBCL] which is the platform&compiler i used in the competition.
