{% include mathjs %}

Hi, I am naurril, a software engineer.

My insterests include programming languages, machine learning algorithms, big data analysis  platform/architecture. Sometimes I do bigdata/ML competitons, and I got a runner-up in [The Last Mile Rush] competition hosted by Tianchi Aliyun in 2016.

I write codes in c/c++, scala, common lisp, python, R, haskell, SQL, and JS. In [The Last Mile Rush] competition, I implemented a complicated large-scale [VRP] optimization algorithm in common lisp, and I also committed (and was accepted) a bug fix to [SBCL] which is the platform&compiler i used in the competition.

I implemented a [message parsing language] many years ago, it's a python like tiny programming language, can be used to parse messages in all kinds of protocols (If you have experience in telecommunication protocols, you definitly know what I am taking about). It's written in C++.
